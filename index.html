								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<img align="right" style="margin:10px;"  src="images/bhavay.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" />
								<p>I am a Theoretical Physicist, currently pursuing a PhD at the <a href="https://www.uh.edu/nsm/" target="_blank">College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics</a> in <a href="https://www.uh.edu/" target="_blank">University of Houston</a>. By the way, check out my <h3><a href="#work"> Work</a></h3></p>
								<p>I am interested in the quantum nature of gravity and the geometrical anatomy of spacetime. Dualities in physics is a gamechanging idea that fascinates me a lot. I use tools and principles of Quantum Field Thery, String Theory and mathematical physics. More recently I have developed interest in the connection between Quantum Information Science, Quantum Chaos, The SYK Model, The Schwarzian action, and the list goes on. Thats what! Everything is connected. I'm curious to know how and why.
								<p>I am a musician at heart and I love to sing and play the guitar. I love being on stage. The feeling of being an entertainer that takes over is indescribable. I am also an amateur guitar mechanic/collector and vinyl collector, but one day hope to have a very unique collection.
									Music runs through my genes and I can never see my life without it. In fact I can't see "Life" without music. Fun Fact: Music makes the deepest (most fundamental) neural pathways in your brain. Ever thought why you remember so many songs? </p>
								<p>I am also a sports enthusiast and I think that at any given point in time, in life, one must always be associated with atleast one sport. The blend of psychology and the physicality is unparalleled and it helps one grow stronger both mentally and physically. 
									I love playing everything from Cricket, Football, Tennis,...,Chess and even E-Sports. 
									I'm a hardcore Cricket fan though and at one point was on the path of pursuing it professionally. 
								</p>
								<p> So feel free to talk to me about anything. 
									P.S. I'm still exploring myself, so more about me later.<br>
									So how you doing?

							<p>Welcome to my bi-weekly (reverse chronological) blog. This is the best way to stay updated on what I have been to on a weekly basis.
								Having said that, I must also let you know that Grad school plus research plus life keeps me very busy so I'll try 
								my best to honestly update this page bi-weekly. Well lets see how it goes. Now I had to choose to begin the blog somewhere so I chose a special day and you'll read about it shortly.
								Everything before that can be understood from my CV but if you're still interested feel free to drop me a message I'll be happy to chat. I hope you can get something great out all my experiences. 
								Happy reading folks. Cheers. <br>
								About the picture you see above: This was taken on a Friday while coming back home from school. 
								I couldn't believe the first year was over, it went by quicker than a blink of an eye. 
								Here is me staring at the sun as the semester fades away, 
								embracing the endless possibilities of summer. 
							</p>
								<h3>Week 1: March 23 - April 6, 2023</h3>
								<p>The reason I chose to start from this wekk is because this week was extremele special and what's better
									than a special beginning to my blog. It was the end of March and my second semester was in full flow. The first round 
									of midterm exams were over. I still remember I'd failed my Electrodynamics midterm. I had failed an exam for the first time 
									in my life. My love for physics is beyond any failiure and it didn't stop me from continuing my reseaech. Now my advisor comes to 
									school only on Tuesdays and Thursday. This thursday was my first ever research presentation and I was talking about the universality of the 
									Schwarzian action. 
									<img style="margin: auto;" src="images/blogweek1.png" width="97%" height="50%"/>
									The universality arises from the underlying SL(2,R) symmetry group. The presentation went so well and my advisor was very happy. 
									My summer project had been decided. I was content and satisfied and was looking forward to work this project. <br>
								I spent the next two weeks taking apart both my electric guitars. I seem to have developed a liking towards guitar design and mechanics. 
										Both my guitars had missing parts, some of them broke because of my lack of experience as a guitar mechanic so I had to wait for the parts to come before I fixed my guitars. 
										I also celebrated one of my close friends's birthday on the 2nd of April. I also applied for the TPEG scholarship. Which I will let you know if I got or not.
									</p>
									<h3>Week 3: April 6 - April 20, 2023</h3>
								
									<p> <img style="margin: auto;" src="images/blogweek3.jpg" width="97%" height="10%"/>
										On the 14th of April, many student from my department defended their thesis and I got the opportunity to attened some of them. 
										One of the first thing I noticed that you defence will only go well if you get good food for your thesis committee. Its true. 
										I saw it happening. But anyway it was my first time sitting in on a thesis defence and I got to learn a lot and managed to ask 
										great questions to the then PhD students and now Doctorsl. In the night we went to celebrate, laughed, got drunk. <br>
										It was then time for the 2nd round of Midterms. Now Quantum and Stat Mech was fine since they're my strengths but EM...well not so much. 
										I was terrified that I'll fail this time too but I pretty well and was above the average of the class. 
										</p>
									<h3>Week 5: April 20 - May 4, 2023</h3>
									<p> As the Public Relations manager of APS Chapter at UH, I along with my team mates organized a movie night for fellow grad students and we saw Primer, and not single person in the audience got it. 
										Mind you, this was an audience comprised of physicists and physicists only. <br>
										All the midterms were over and there were many events going in the college as it was the beginning of final exam week. 
										It was stressful but Prachi and I really support each other and we don't let either of us stress a lot. 

									</p>

								<p>I am an active and passionate science propagator. I Co-founded Beyond Portals, to promote and popularize research in fundamental sciences. 
									We also support minorities in STEM and provide them with a platform to learn, grow and guide them to pursue a career in fields they are passionate about. 
									According to my experiences I strongly feel that the education system of the world needs a major fix and that is what keeps me motivated towards building a community of people 
									sharing revolutionay ideas and are equally passionate and willing to collectively build a platform that has the potential to transform education, academics, research as well as industry across the globe.</p>
									<p>We organize public talks, workshops and seminars online as well as offline. Our members are actively working on tapping into areas like social media, e-schooling etc. and are constantly coming up with new ideas 
										and approaches to efficiently propagate our ideas. I hope those sharing similar ideas will join hands with us and make this dream come true. Stay tuned. </p>

								<h3>Black Hole Information Problem and Recent Developments (September 2021):</h3>
								<p>I was invited by the Quantum Photonics Physics Forum to give a talk about the Black Hole Information 
									Problem and recent developments. Starting with Bekenstein and Hawking's field theoretic treament of Black Holes (QFT in a curved background) and how the information problem was born 
									I explained recent advancements that have been possible with the help of holography, computation of entanglement entropy of the black hole as well as the Hawking radiation and understanding the gravitational path integral. 
									I also talked about the role of Quantum Information Science and error correction that has recently surfaced.

					<article id="SM">
						<h3>Supermoon 2018</h3>
										<p>On the 2nd of January 2018 we organised the first ever public talk of Beyond Portals in Delhi,
											India. We had an audience of 30 and all the founders spoke about various interesting phenomena in physics. We
										organised an interation round where we talked about the science behind science fiction concepts in movies and other TV series. 
											The finale and the highlight was setting up our telescope and watching the supermoon of 2018. It was a great evening and a perfect way 
											to kickstart the idea that we had throughout our undergrad journey.
