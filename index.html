								<blockquote>He who doesn't fear death dies only once. - Giovanni Falcone</blockquote>
								<span><img style="margin:10px;"  src="images/bhavay.jpg" width="100%" height="" /></span>
								
								<p>I am a Theoretical Physicist, currently pursuing a PhD at the <a href="https://www.uh.edu/nsm/" target="_blank">College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics</a> in <a href="https://www.uh.edu/" target="_blank">University of Houston</a>. By the way, <blockquote><a href="#work" class="button"> Check Out My Work Here!</a></blockquote></p>
								<p>I am interested in the quantum nature of gravity and the geometrical anatomy of spacetime. Dualities in physics is a gamechanging idea that fascinates me a lot. I use tools and principles of Quantum Field Thery, String Theory and mathematical physics. More recently I have developed interest in the connection between Quantum Information Science, Quantum Chaos, The SYK Model, The Schwarzian action, and the list goes on. Thats what! Everything is connected. I'm curious to know how and why.
								<p>I am a musician at heart and I love to sing and play the guitar. I love being on stage. The feeling of being an entertainer that takes over is indescribable. I am also an amateur guitar mechanic/collector and vinyl collector, but one day hope to have a very unique collection.
									Music runs through my genes and I can never see my life without it. In fact I can't see "Life" without music. Fun Fact: Music makes the deepest (most fundamental) neural pathways in your brain. Ever thought why you remember so many songs? </p>
								<p>I am also a sports enthusiast and I think that at any given point in time, in life, one must always be associated with atleast one sport. The blend of psychology and the physicality is unparalleled and it helps one grow stronger both mentally and physically. 
									I love playing everything from Cricket, Football, Tennis,...,Chess and even E-Sports. 
									I'm a hardcore Cricket fan though and at one point was on the path of pursuing it professionally. 
								</p>
								<p> So feel free to talk to me about anything. 
									<br>
									P.S. I'm still exploring myself, so more about me later.<br>
									How you doing?

								<h3><a href="/assets/CV.pdf" class="button primary">CV</a></h3>
								<h3 class="major">Current Work</h3>
								<p>I'm currently exploring the SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) 0+1-D Model of Majorana Fermions with quartic interactions and disorder.
									This model is perturbatively solvable in the UV and is also analytical in the IR in the large N limit. In the strong coupling or the low temperature limit
									the model develops a conformal symmetry which allows us to study the model around critical the point. This model was originally 
									developed to study magnets but Kitaev realised that in this low coupling limit the model is dual to a theory of gravity in 1+1 dimensions.
									The model also displays many other characteristics like saturating the bound on chaos. THis bound is also saturatrd by black holes. 
									As a result this model rose to fame as a candidate (toy) quantum gravity model to obviously explore the quantum effects of gravity. 
									The model, in the strong coupling limit, has an effective action which contains a schwarzian derivative which is complicated to solve. My work is to analyze this action 
									in this limit and find simpler solvable actions to further the understanding of this model.

							<p>Welcome to my monthly (reverse chronological) blog. This is the best way to stay updated on what I have been  yp to on a monthly basis.
								Having said that, I must also let you know that Grad school plus research plus life keeps me very busy so I'll try 
								my best to honestly update this page monthly. Well lets see how it goes. Now I had to choose to begin the blog somewhere so I chose a special day and you'll read about it shortly.
								Everything before that can be understood from my CV but if you're still interested feel free to drop me a message I'll be happy to chat. I hope you can get something great out of all my experiences. 
								Happy reading folks. Cheers. <br>
								About the picture you see above: This was taken on a Friday while coming back home from school. 
								I couldn't believe the first year was over, it went by quicker than a blink of an eye. 
								Here is me staring at the sun as the semester fades away, 
								embracing the endless possibilities of summer. 
							</p>
							<h3>June 2023</h3>		
							<blockquote>
								<span><img src="/images/june2023.JPG" width="100%"/></span>
								June was amazing. I had a wonderful teaching summer experience. The summer semester is shorter so I was basically teaching all week but I managed my 
								time pretty well. I finished a lecture series on <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDfPUNusx1Ep5g1jIKXqpNX_t_Zz-kAlQ">Conformal Field Theory</a> by Tobias Osborne and <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_kQfq_5BKqq1xPQe3LHeAuAoLyCMZx4Y">Advanced Quantum Field Theory</a> by Nabil Iqbal. 
								I highly recommed both of them. On top of that I also squeezed in my research on the SYK model and made some decent progress. I saw the first ever installation of 
								'Dreamsonic 2023' a prog rock tour with Animals as Leaders, Devin Townsend and Dream Theater. WHat a show! 
								I also began my weightloss journey after finally finding time in the summer. The goal is to go below 80kg this time and I have already lost 7kg. Current weight is 
								98kg so >18kg more to lose. I feel focused and I'm also working out. Summer is all about getting back in shape isn't it?
								We had many interesting guests over the first month of summer and we're learning so much about podcasting and gaining so much knowledge along the way. 
								Go check out the podcast if you haven't already. We're also on Patron and your support is invaluable.

							<h3>May 2023</h3>
									<blockquote>
										<span><img src="/images/may2023.jpg" width="100%"/></span>
										Well honestly May...was stressfull. I had my final set of exams in the first week which weren't well spaced but
										nothing could be done about it. So I gave all my exams did very well on all of them except EM (just passed).
										But it was done and exams were over and so was the 2nd semester. The picture you see about is right after attending a 
										colloquium by a former group member who is now a post doc at IQC waterloo. 
										What followed were a series of end sem parties just to celebrate the end of first year and get rid of all the stress. 
										Prachi and I along with a bunch of friends went to so many concerts we saw RHCP, Ed Sheeran and many more. 
										May 2023 has a special place in my heart because this was when Prachi and I gave birth to our brainchild <a href="#TKP">"The Knowmads Podcast"</a>.
										We had been planning to start a podcast for a year now and this was the right time and place. 
										We are looking forward to have enlightening conversations about STEM, culture, philosophy, psychology and primarily 
										we will focus on the reality of graduate life. Looking forward to see y'all there and your suggfestions for guests. 
										I will also be TAing this summer semester and will be teaching Physics 1 (Mechanics) Lab. 
										While may was going great the end of the month sucked - Prachi's phone was stolen at a Target, the police obviously did not help at all 
										and we had to deal with most of it ourselves. We literally tracked the phone down using find my Iphone and still the police could not 
										retrieve it. Well if you want more details about the entire incident feel free to chat. 

									</blockquote>
									<h3>Week 5: April 20 - May 4, 2023</h3>
									<blockquote> As the Public Relations manager of APS Chapter at UH, I along with my team mates organized a movie night for fellow grad students and we saw Primer, and not single person in the audience got it. 
										Mind you, this was an audience comprised of physicists and physicists only. <br>
										All the midterms were over and there were many events going in the college as it was the beginning of final exam week. 
										It was stressful but Prachi and I really support each other and we don't let either of us stress a lot. 

									</blockquote>
									<h3>Week 3: April 6 - April 20, 2023</h3>
								
									<blockquote> <img style="margin: auto;" src="images/blogweek3.jpg" width="97%" height="10%"/>
										On the 14th of April, many student from my department defended their thesis and I got the opportunity to attened some of them. 
										One of the first thing I noticed that you defence will only go well if you get good food for your thesis committee. Its true. 
										I saw it happening. But anyway it was my first time sitting in on a thesis defence and I got to learn a lot and managed to ask 
										great questions to the then PhD students and now Doctorsl. In the night we went to celebrate, laughed, got drunk. <br>
										It was then time for the 2nd round of Midterms. Now Quantum and Stat Mech was fine since they're my strengths but EM...well not so much. 
										I was terrified that I'll fail this time too but I did pretty well and was above the average of the class. 
										<br>
										This is me feeding a squirrel after a successful presentation: 
										<span><img src="/images/mensquirrel.jpg" width="100%" /></span>

									<h3>Week 1: March 23 - April 6, 2023</h3>
								<blockquote>The reason I chose to start from this wekk is because this week was extremele special and what's better
									than a special beginning to my blog. It was the end of March and my second semester was in full flow. The first round 
									of midterm exams were over. I still remember I'd failed my Electrodynamics midterm. I had failed an exam for the first time 
									in my life. My love for physics is beyond any failiure and it didn't stop me from continuing my reseaech. Now my advisor comes to 
									school only on Tuesdays and Thursday. This thursday was my first ever research presentation and I was talking about the universality of the 
									Schwarzian action. 
									<img style="margin: auto;" src="images/blogweek1.png" width="97%" height="50%"/>
									The universality arises from the underlying SL(2,R) symmetry group. The presentation went so well and my advisor was very happy. 
									My summer project had been decided. I was content and satisfied and was looking forward to work this project. <br>
								I spent the next two weeks taking apart both my electric guitars. I seem to have developed a liking towards guitar design and mechanics. 
										Both my guitars had missing parts, some of them broke because of my lack of experience as a guitar mechanic so I had to wait for the parts to come before I fixed my guitars. 
										I also celebrated one of my close friends's birthday on the 2nd of April. I also applied for the TPEG scholarship. Which I will let you know if I got or not.

												<li><h3>Aymen on the Essence of Soft Skills in your PhD</h3></li>
												<span><img src="/images/ep8.png" width="100%"/></span>
												<blockquote>
													During the academic stages of our lives we spend most of our time developing tools and skills that aid our research and problem solving ability and this is true for all fields of study. Now most students think that this is it! This is how you can essentially get your dream position. 
Well what is often missed are the soft skills that are absolutely crucial to provide us that edge over others when applying for jobs. Our guest today is almost at the end of his PhD and has effectively picked up on some of these skills throughout his journey and we understood the essence of sharing it with the world. In this conversation we talk about the effect of time management, having a platform to showcase yourself, networking, a functional relationship with your advisor and much more. It was truly an honest and candid conversation with a lot of perspectives hope you enjoy it.
												</blockquote>
												<li><h3>Andrew Baldassarre on patriarchal realism and the pedagogical power of porn</h3></li>
												<span><img src="/images/ep7.PNG" width="100%"/></span>
											<blockquote>Every rational human has once in their life thought about the implications of porn on oneself and the society. Gail Dines, an anti-porn sociologist and professor at Wheelock college claims in her work that due to the adverse implications of pornography, it has become a public health issue and perhaps a solution is to enforce a complete ban on the porn industry. Our guest today Andrew Baldassarre is a philosopher and his current work is in response to this idea. He believes that it is important to acknowledge the pedagogical power of porn and to harness this aspect for the betterment of our society.</blockquote>
											<li><h3>Deepak Singh Rawat on Literature, fiction and philosophy</h3></li>
												<span><img src="/images/ep6.PNG" width="100%"/></span>
											<blockquote>The path to self-exploration is very unique for everyone. Our passion, ambition and relationships play an instrumental role in shaping our lives. Our guest today found his true expression and self in literature. His humility and empathy allowed him to overcome all the challenges that life threw at him. With exploring literature, friendships, love, life and lots of laughter, this was one of the most heartfelt conversation in a very long time.</blockquote>
											<li><h3>Bikash Panthi on Challenges Faced by International Students in the US</h3></li>
												<span><img src="/images/ep5.jpg" width="100%"/></span>
												<blockquote>A lot of students all around the world leave their home country and move to another county to prsue higher education. We often talk about their learnings and success but in reality what goes behind all that enlightenment is mostly never talked about. Our guest today has a PhD in physics who left his country, his family in Nepal, to pursue his career in the states. Even though this journey was not ideal, his sanguine nature lead him to where he is now.</blockquote>
												<li><h3>Pablo Lopez-Duque on the research community, physics and philosophy</h3></li>
												<span><img src="/images/ep4.JPG" width="100%"/></span>
												<blockquote>We all know PhD one complete adventure like none other. There exist factors that we don't know anything when we begin our PhD. You can never expect how drastically the research project, advisor and the overall situation can change. Our guest today faced all such challenges and it only made him more strong, mature and confident. From having material science as his primary interest he now works in the Quantum Gravity Group.</blockquote>
												<li><h3>Caleb Broodo on Basketball, Engineering and life as a Physics Graduate Student</h3></li>
												<span><img src="/images/ep3.jpg" width="100%"/></span>
												<blockquote>In Life one finds it difficult to find what truly makes them happy. Our guest today is someone who did not have such a problem. He is a physics graduate student, but that's not how his journey began. Caleb Broodo left his basketball career, his dream to play in the NBA and his engineering pursuit to pursue his other dream of becoming a physicist.</blockquote>
												<li><h3>Tripp Moss on Changing Careers, from being a wealth manager to a grad student</h3></li>
												<span><img src="/images/ep2.PNG" width="100%"/></span>
												<blockquote>Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you you're passionate about something, you love something and you've learn to appreciate it from a very very young age but then life happened. Our guest today did his undergrad in mechanical engineering and physics but had to make a circumstantial switch to the finance industry. He then spent more than six year and found his was back to physics. This is a fun, fascinating and a very exciting episode. We hope to inspire people in similar situations and we want to let them know that they're not alone and all hope is not lost.</blockquote>
													
												<li><h3>Pilot</h3></li>
												<span><img src="/images/ep1.PNG" width="100%"/></span>
												<blockquote>You've already seen our Vlogs and enjoyed our nomadic side. We have been planning to do this Podcast for a very long and finally we found the time to make it happen. We finally justify the 'Know' of Knowmads and we kickstart this podcast by addressing a common question that we always get: "How do you manage your relationship being in the same profession? How do you manage your personal and professional life? and much more.." We come out completely honest about what bothers us and how we actually make it work. We would love to inspire those in a similar situation and we hope that others can also take something from this. We hope to have ya'll along this journey of exploring not just ourselves but also the world around us. We also look forward to expand our knowledge along with you. We will try to bring unique stories and research that will definitely help people in graduate school.</blockquote>

											<h2 class="major">Books and me</h2>
											<blockquote> My tryst with books is fairly recent. I picked up on reading in the my undergrad. Before that I would 
											think that books (I mean fiction) was a waste of time. My girlfriend (bestfriend back then) introduced me to my first ever fiction 
											which was Eleven Minutes by Paolo Coelho. I instantly fell for books. It became a tool for me to gain perspectives and strengthen my power of empathy. Having said that I honestly still struglle to finish a lot of books but 
											love the journey. I'm not an expert and certainly not the person with a ton of recommendations but I can recommed some great mind-blowing stuff. I'm open to recommendations all the time. 
											I'm definitely someone who reads so many books at a time, I might not finish them all but I like to explore as much as I can, given my graduate life schedule.

											<blockquote>
												If Music be the Food of Love, Play On. - William Shakespeare
											</blockquote>
											<img src="/images/music.png" width="100%"/>
											I have always been a musician at heart. If not a physicist I would pursue music as my career.
											My journey as a musician was very organic. Although it is important to say that I'm the son of the greatest musician in the world "Mr. Rajieve Saarang". My father never forced my to do music but he made sure that Music was always there during my grooming stages. 
											I have seen Jam sessions as a very small kid without ear plugs. So the damage has been done. Music has been engrained in me. 
											I had met with an accident when I was in the 5th grade and I designate that incident to be life changing, a canon event if you would like that. I started loving physics and picked up the guitar.
											I have never stopped since then. I was in the school band during high school. I was the front man in my undergraduate band. Music is my expression and 
											it has helped my grow, it has shaped my personality and through music I explored the various cultures of the world. 
											I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BhavaySaarangTyagi">youtube channel</a> that goes way back, I'm not super active but you surely see me hit puberty to a fully grown adult on that channel while enjoying the music I have to share.
