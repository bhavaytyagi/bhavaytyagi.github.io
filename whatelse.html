											<p>I have always been a musician at heart. If not a physicist I would pursue music as my career.
											My journey as a musician was very organic. Although it is important to say that I'm the son of the greatest musician in the world "Mr. Rajieve Saarang". My father never forced me to do music but he made sure that Music was always there during my grooming stages. 
											I have seen Jam sessions as a very small kid without ear plugs. So the damage has been done. Music has been engrained in me. 
											I had met with an accident when I was in the 5th grade and I designate that incident to be life changing, a canon event if you would like that. I started loving physics and picked up the guitar.
											I have never stopped since then. I was in the school band during high school. I was the front man in my undergraduate band. Music is my expression and 
											it has helped me grow, it has shaped my personality and through music I explored the various cultures of the world. 
											I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BhavaySaarangTyagi">youtube channel</a> that goes way back, I'm not super active but you surely see me hit puberty to a fully grown adult on that channel while enjoying the music I have to share.
